In this assignment, you will implement two scheduling algorithms: First-come first-serve (FCFS) and priority-based scheduling. You will report the average wait and turnaround times for all your processes. Assuming uniq (user) and uniq (kernel) are two different processes, similar to your prior assignment, you will create a new test.c that calls both programs and reports these statistics. Similarly, you will repeat the procedure for different processes.
Test_scenarios
FCFS When user processes arrive before the kernel process, report all the statistics. Whenever the kernel process arrives before the user, report all statistics Priority When the User process has the highest priority, report your scheduler statistics. When the kernel processes have the highest priority, report your scheduler statistics.
